## Projects 📝

### Project 1: Users Contribution Prediction Model - Fintual
*(Python, Machine Learning)*

-Developed as part of the MDS7201 course in the Master of Data Science program at the University of Chile. Conducted in collaboration with Fintual.
-Analysis of disaggregated data from Fintual platform users, consisting of over 435,000 observations over a period of 2 years.
-Evaluation of classification and regression models for predicting which users will make deposits on the platform and the amount of those deposits.

### Project 2: Segmentation Model for Training and Services - Technological Institute of Production (ITP)
*(Python, Natural Language Processing)*

-Developed as part of the IN6531 course in the Faculty of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at the University of Chile. Conducted in collaboration with ITP in Peru.
-Analysis of data with over 192,000 observations of services provided by the CITE Network, between January 2018 and July 2021.
-NLP techniques were used to apply a text clustering model (kmeans) to segment the services provided by ITP and the CITE Network.
